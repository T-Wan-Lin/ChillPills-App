Hello, we are Wan Lin and Aatmika from Team 5334.

This is our Orbital application, ChillPills.

# About Chillpills
Motivation: 

As the saying goes, life is a marathon, not a sprint. We have to pace ourselves properly so that we have enough energy for the long road ahead of us. Many studies have shown that taking breaks (5 to 90 minutes) in between study or work routines can positively affect attention abilities, improving focus and productivity. There are many activities that can be done during the break to re-energize the body, such as going for a walk or a run. Even a five-minute meditation session has a great positive influence on your mental health and gives us clarity. 

However, the hyper-competitive culture in Singapore has inculcated the ‘work-hard, play later’ mindset into students and workers, leading to high stress and burnout rates. As students ourselves, we have become fearful of incorporating breaks into our routines as we are afraid that such ‘lost’ time could have a negative impact on our academic performance, leaving us vulnerable to burnouts and mental breakdowns.

If we can’t remind ourselves to chill, why not have something else, perhaps a little genie in your pocket, to encourage and incentivise us to take breaks and recommend activities for us to do to unwind and relax regularly?

Aim:

We hope that with our application, users will be able to incorporate regular breaks into their routines and perform activities that improve their mental and physical health, which in turn helps prevent burnouts.
